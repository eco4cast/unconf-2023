# Ecological Forecasting Initiative 2023 Unconference

Brainstorming repo to propose and discuss unconference project ideas!

If you do not have a GitHub account, we encourage you to sign up for one. You can see the Issues and discussions posted, but without a GitHub account, you won’t be able to add comments.  Once you have a GitHub account, you will be able to add a project idea by clicking on the green “New Issue” button in the upper right corner. We encourage you to also add suggestions or comments to projects already created by going to the issue using the comments box.  If you run into issues with this, don’t hesitate to reach out and we will be happy to help.  Our goal is to build up the list of potential projects before the meeting and identify who might be interested in working on specific projects.
